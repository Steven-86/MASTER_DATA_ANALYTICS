        "Il problema delle fake news è cresciuto esponenzialmente nell'ultimo decennio a causa della crescente diffusione dei social network, il governo degli Stati Uniti ha deciso di muoversi a tal proposito, incaricando la tua azienda di realizzare un plug-in per chrome in grado di riconoscere se una notizia è falsa. Il tuo compito è quello di realizzare il modello in grado di riconoscere le notizie false, che poi il team di machine learning enginner e web developer metterà in produzione. Ti vengono messi a disposizioni due raccolte di notizie, una contenente solo notizie false e l'altra contenente solo notizie vere, utilizzale per addestrare il tuo modello.\n",

According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"flag\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

(Reuters) - Washington has dramatically increased tensions in talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement by proposing that the lifespan of any new deal be limited to five years, people familiar with the negotiations said on Thursday. The proposal for a so-called sunset clause - just one of a series of U.S. initiatives that are opposed by NAFTA partners Canada and Mexico - only served to increase uncertainty about the future of the deal. Two sources with direct knowledge of the talks described the atmosphere as \\u201chorrible\\u201d and highly charged. The U.S. side proposed the sunset clause late on Wednesday during the fourth of seven scheduled rounds to update the rules governing one of the world\\u2019s biggest trade blocs, said two officials, who asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential. The Trump administration says the clause, causing NAFTA to expire every five years unless all three countries agree it should continue, is to ensure the pact stays up to date. But Mexico and Canada insist there is no point updating the pact with such a threat hanging over it, arguing the clause would stunt investment by sowing too much uncertainty about the future of the agreement. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a source of total uncertainty,\\u201d said one of the NAFTA government officials. Speaking in Mexico City, Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said the government was working on plans to alter tariffs and identify substitute markets in case the NAFTA talks failed. His remarks and the tension around NAFTA helped push the peso down 1 percent against the U.S. dollar to a five-month low. U.S. President Donald Trump says NAFTA, originally signed in 1994, has been a disaster for the United States and has frequently threatened to scrap it unless major changes are made. Business and farm groups say abandoning the 23-year-old pact would wreak economic havoc, disrupting cross-border manufacturing supply chains and slapping high tariffs on agricultural products. Trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico has quadrupled under NAFTA, now topping $1.2 trillion a year. In addition to the sunset clause, the United States wants to boost how much North American content autos must contain to qualify for tax-free status and eliminate a dispute settlement mechanisms that Canada insists must stay. Some trade observers said it is difficult to see how negotiators could reach an agreement given U.S. demands that many see as non-starters. The head of Unifor, Canada\\u2019s largest private sector labor union, said it was clear the United States did not want a deal. \\u201cNAFTA is not going anywhere. This thing is going into the toilet,\\u201d Jerry Dias told reporters on Thursday. Despite clear signs of impatience from Canada in particular, U.S. negotiators have yet to submit their proposal on rules of origin for the auto sector. That looked unlikely to come before Friday, another official familiar with the talks said. Trump on Wednesday repeated his warnings that he might terminate the pact and said he was open to doing a bilateral deal with either Canada or Mexico. He was speaking alongside Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who later said Canada was \\u201cbraced\\u201d for Trump\\u2019s unpredictability. Negotiators were also set to cover the difficult issue of government procurement on Thursday. Canada and Mexico want their companies to be able to bid on more U.S. federal and state government contracts, but this is at odds with Trump\\u2019s \\u201cBuy American\\u201d agenda. U.S. negotiators have countered with a proposal that would effectively grant the other countries less access, people familiar with the talks say. On automotive rules of origin, NAFTA negotiators face tough new U.S. demands to increase regional vehicle content to 85 percent from 62.5 percent, with 50 percent required from the United States, according to people briefed on the plan.  The rules of origin demands are among several conditions that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has labeled \\u201cpoison pill proposals\\u201d that threaten to torpedo the talks. \",\n          \"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City\\u2019s Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a $82.2 billion budget plan for the 2017 fiscal year on Tuesday, and promised an overhaul of the city\\u2019s ailing public hospitals that treat large numbers of undocumented patients. De Blasio, who hails from progressive circles of the Democratic Party, took office in 2014 after winning a landslide victory on a platform to reduce inequalities in the city. \\u201cAt its core, our budget is our roadmap for lifting up communities,\\u201d de Blasio said. \\u201cThe strategic investments we have put to work in every neighborhood, coupled with disciplined fiscal management, are producing real results for New Yorkers.\\u201d De Blasio said the city\\u2019s public hospital system, recently rebranded as Health & Hospitals, is facing spiraling costs due to undocumented patients and would see a $1.8 billion deficit by 2020 if the city took no action. The executive budget dedicates $2 billion to overhauling the $7.5 billion system, which treats around 1.4 million people per year. About a third of its patients are undocumented immigrants and cost the system over $2 billion each year, the mayor said. Health & Hospitals core revenue from treating poorer patients on federal and state support is under pressure as more private hospitals compete for these patients. That has left the system with a larger share of undocumented patients.     The executive budget plan for the fiscal year beginning July 1 closely tracks a preliminary budget estimate of $82.1 billion the mayor presented in January. The total budget represents a small increase over the previous year\\u2019s $81.7 billion spending plan. The executive budget increases the city\\u2019s reserves by $250 million, bringing its retiree health benefits trust fund to $3.7 billion. General reserves amount to $1 billion and $500 million is allocated to the city\\u2019s capital stabilization reserve. Budget officials said reserves were the highest in the city\\u2019s history. The mayor has repeatedly stressed the need to prepare for an economic downtown in which the city would have to \\u201cgo it alone\\u201d with reduced federal and state support. \",\n          \"The author of  Clinton Cash  responds to Hillary Clinton s brazen dishonesty. Who does she think she s fooling   is she lying or just very incompetent? I think it s brazen dishonesty.  I was not personally involved because that wasn t something the secretary of state did,  said Clinton.The transfer of 20 percent of US uranium   the stuff used to build nuclear weapons   to Vladimir Putin did not rise to the level of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s time and attention?Beyond being an admission of extreme executive negligence on an issue of utmost national security, Hillary s statement strains credulity to the breaking point for at least three other reasons.First, nine investors who profited from the uranium deal collectively donated $145 million to Hillary s family foundation, including Clinton Foundation mega donor and Canadian mining billionaire Frank Giustra, who pledged $100 million. Since 2005, Giustra and Bill Clinton have frequently globetrotted together, and there s even a Clinton Foundation initiative named the Clinton-Giustra initiative. But Hillary expects Americans to believe she had no knowledge that a man who made a nine-figure donation to her foundation was deeply involved in the deal? Nor eight other mining executives, all of whom also donated to her foundation?Second, during her Sunday interview, Clinton was asked about the Kremlin-backed bank that paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a single speech delivered in Moscow. Hillary s response? She dodged the question completely and instead offered this blurry evasion.  The timing doesn t work,  said Clinton.  It happened in terms of the support for the foundation before I was secretary of state.  Hillary added that such  allegations  are being  made by people who are wielding the partisan axe.  The reason Hillary ignored addressing the $500,000 direct payment from the Kremlin-backed bank to her husband is because that payment occurred, as the Times confirms,  shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One.  And as for her comment that the timing of the uranium investors  donations  doesn t work  as a damning revelation, in fact, the timing works perfectly. As Clinton Cash revealed and others have confirmed, Uranium One s then-chief Ian Telfer made donations totaling $2.35 million that Hillary Clinton s foundation kept hidden. Telfer s donations occurred as Hillary s State Department was considering the Uranium One deal. Third, Clinton correctly notes in the interview that  there were nine government agencies who had to sign off on that deal.  What she leaves out, of course, is that her State Department was one of them, and the only agency whose chief received $145 million in donations from shareholders in the deal. Does she honestly expect Americans to believe she was simply unaware that the deal was even under consideration in her own State Department?Read more here: New York Post\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"Middle-east\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Oct 14, 2017\",\n          \"April 15, 2016 \",\n          \"Feb 7, 2016\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"flag\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 12961,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 44897,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 44898,\n        \"samples\": [\n          38994,\n          38871\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

(Reuters) - Washington has dramatically increased tensions in talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement by proposing that the lifespan of any new deal be limited to five years, people familiar with the negotiations said on Thursday. The proposal for a so-called sunset clause - just one of a series of U.S. initiatives that are opposed by NAFTA partners Canada and Mexico - only served to increase uncertainty about the future of the deal. Two sources with direct knowledge of the talks described the atmosphere as \\u201chorrible\\u201d and highly charged. The U.S. side proposed the sunset clause late on Wednesday during the fourth of seven scheduled rounds to update the rules governing one of the world\\u2019s biggest trade blocs, said two officials, who asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential. The Trump administration says the clause, causing NAFTA to expire every five years unless all three countries agree it should continue, is to ensure the pact stays up to date. But Mexico and Canada insist there is no point updating the pact with such a threat hanging over it, arguing the clause would stunt investment by sowing too much uncertainty about the future of the agreement. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a source of total uncertainty,\\u201d said one of the NAFTA government officials. Speaking in Mexico City, Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said the government was working on plans to alter tariffs and identify substitute markets in case the NAFTA talks failed. His remarks and the tension around NAFTA helped push the peso down 1 percent against the U.S. dollar to a five-month low. U.S. President Donald Trump says NAFTA, originally signed in 1994, has been a disaster for the United States and has frequently threatened to scrap it unless major changes are made. Business and farm groups say abandoning the 23-year-old pact would wreak economic havoc, disrupting cross-border manufacturing supply chains and slapping high tariffs on agricultural products. Trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico has quadrupled under NAFTA, now topping $1.2 trillion a year. In addition to the sunset clause, the United States wants to boost how much North American content autos must contain to qualify for tax-free status and eliminate a dispute settlement mechanisms that Canada insists must stay. Some trade observers said it is difficult to see how negotiators could reach an agreement given U.S. demands that many see as non-starters. The head of Unifor, Canada\\u2019s largest private sector labor union, said it was clear the United States did not want a deal. \\u201cNAFTA is not going anywhere. This thing is going into the toilet,\\u201d Jerry Dias told reporters on Thursday. Despite clear signs of impatience from Canada in particular, U.S. negotiators have yet to submit their proposal on rules of origin for the auto sector. That looked unlikely to come before Friday, another official familiar with the talks said. Trump on Wednesday repeated his warnings that he might terminate the pact and said he was open to doing a bilateral deal with either Canada or Mexico. He was speaking alongside Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who later said Canada was \\u201cbraced\\u201d for Trump\\u2019s unpredictability. Negotiators were also set to cover the difficult issue of government procurement on Thursday. Canada and Mexico want their companies to be able to bid on more U.S. federal and state government contracts, but this is at odds with Trump\\u2019s \\u201cBuy American\\u201d agenda. U.S. negotiators have countered with a proposal that would effectively grant the other countries less access, people familiar with the talks say. On automotive rules of origin, NAFTA negotiators face tough new U.S. demands to increase regional vehicle content to 85 percent from 62.5 percent, with 50 percent required from the United States, according to people briefed on the plan.  The rules of origin demands are among several conditions that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has labeled \\u201cpoison pill proposals\\u201d that threaten to torpedo the talks. \",\n          \"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City\\u2019s Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a $82.2 billion budget plan for the 2017 fiscal year on Tuesday, and promised an overhaul of the city\\u2019s ailing public hospitals that treat large numbers of undocumented patients. De Blasio, who hails from progressive circles of the Democratic Party, took office in 2014 after winning a landslide victory on a platform to reduce inequalities in the city. \\u201cAt its core, our budget is our roadmap for lifting up communities,\\u201d de Blasio said. \\u201cThe strategic investments we have put to work in every neighborhood, coupled with disciplined fiscal management, are producing real results for New Yorkers.\\u201d De Blasio said the city\\u2019s public hospital system, recently rebranded as Health & Hospitals, is facing spiraling costs due to undocumented patients and would see a $1.8 billion deficit by 2020 if the city took no action. The executive budget dedicates $2 billion to overhauling the $7.5 billion system, which treats around 1.4 million people per year. About a third of its patients are undocumented immigrants and cost the system over $2 billion each year, the mayor said. Health & Hospitals core revenue from treating poorer patients on federal and state support is under pressure as more private hospitals compete for these patients. That has left the system with a larger share of undocumented patients.     The executive budget plan for the fiscal year beginning July 1 closely tracks a preliminary budget estimate of $82.1 billion the mayor presented in January. The total budget represents a small increase over the previous year\\u2019s $81.7 billion spending plan. The executive budget increases the city\\u2019s reserves by $250 million, bringing its retiree health benefits trust fund to $3.7 billion. General reserves amount to $1 billion and $500 million is allocated to the city\\u2019s capital stabilization reserve. Budget officials said reserves were the highest in the city\\u2019s history. The mayor has repeatedly stressed the need to prepare for an economic downtown in which the city would have to \\u201cgo it alone\\u201d with reduced federal and state support. \",\n          \"The author of  Clinton Cash  responds to Hillary Clinton s brazen dishonesty. Who does she think she s fooling   is she lying or just very incompetent? I think it s brazen dishonesty.  I was not personally involved because that wasn t something the secretary of state did,  said Clinton.The transfer of 20 percent of US uranium   the stuff used to build nuclear weapons   to Vladimir Putin did not rise to the level of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s time and attention?Beyond being an admission of extreme executive negligence on an issue of utmost national security, Hillary s statement strains credulity to the breaking point for at least three other reasons.First, nine investors who profited from the uranium deal collectively donated $145 million to Hillary s family foundation, including Clinton Foundation mega donor and Canadian mining billionaire Frank Giustra, who pledged $100 million. Since 2005, Giustra and Bill Clinton have frequently globetrotted together, and there s even a Clinton Foundation initiative named the Clinton-Giustra initiative. But Hillary expects Americans to believe she had no knowledge that a man who made a nine-figure donation to her foundation was deeply involved in the deal? Nor eight other mining executives, all of whom also donated to her foundation?Second, during her Sunday interview, Clinton was asked about the Kremlin-backed bank that paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a single speech delivered in Moscow. Hillary s response? She dodged the question completely and instead offered this blurry evasion.  The timing doesn t work,  said Clinton.  It happened in terms of the support for the foundation before I was secretary of state.  Hillary added that such  allegations  are being  made by people who are wielding the partisan axe.  The reason Hillary ignored addressing the $500,000 direct payment from the Kremlin-backed bank to her husband is because that payment occurred, as the Times confirms,  shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One.  And as for her comment that the timing of the uranium investors  donations  doesn t work  as a damning revelation, in fact, the timing works perfectly. As Clinton Cash revealed and others have confirmed, Uranium One s then-chief Ian Telfer made donations totaling $2.35 million that Hillary Clinton s foundation kept hidden. Telfer s donations occurred as Hillary s State Department was considering the Uranium One deal. Third, Clinton correctly notes in the interview that  there were nine government agencies who had to sign off on that deal.  What she leaves out, of course, is that her State Department was one of them, and the only agency whose chief received $145 million in donations from shareholders in the deal. Does she honestly expect Americans to believe she was simply unaware that the deal was even under consideration in her own State Department?Read more here: New York Post\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"Middle-east\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Oct 14, 2017\",\n          \"April 15, 2016 \",\n          \"Feb 7, 2016\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"flag\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 12961,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 44897,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 44898,\n        \"samples\": [\n          38994,\n          38871\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tokenized_title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

(Reuters) - Washington has dramatically increased tensions in talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement by proposing that the lifespan of any new deal be limited to five years, people familiar with the negotiations said on Thursday. The proposal for a so-called sunset clause - just one of a series of U.S. initiatives that are opposed by NAFTA partners Canada and Mexico - only served to increase uncertainty about the future of the deal. Two sources with direct knowledge of the talks described the atmosphere as \\u201chorrible\\u201d and highly charged. The U.S. side proposed the sunset clause late on Wednesday during the fourth of seven scheduled rounds to update the rules governing one of the world\\u2019s biggest trade blocs, said two officials, who asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential. The Trump administration says the clause, causing NAFTA to expire every five years unless all three countries agree it should continue, is to ensure the pact stays up to date. But Mexico and Canada insist there is no point updating the pact with such a threat hanging over it, arguing the clause would stunt investment by sowing too much uncertainty about the future of the agreement. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a source of total uncertainty,\\u201d said one of the NAFTA government officials. Speaking in Mexico City, Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said the government was working on plans to alter tariffs and identify substitute markets in case the NAFTA talks failed. His remarks and the tension around NAFTA helped push the peso down 1 percent against the U.S. dollar to a five-month low. U.S. President Donald Trump says NAFTA, originally signed in 1994, has been a disaster for the United States and has frequently threatened to scrap it unless major changes are made. Business and farm groups say abandoning the 23-year-old pact would wreak economic havoc, disrupting cross-border manufacturing supply chains and slapping high tariffs on agricultural products. Trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico has quadrupled under NAFTA, now topping $1.2 trillion a year. In addition to the sunset clause, the United States wants to boost how much North American content autos must contain to qualify for tax-free status and eliminate a dispute settlement mechanisms that Canada insists must stay. Some trade observers said it is difficult to see how negotiators could reach an agreement given U.S. demands that many see as non-starters. The head of Unifor, Canada\\u2019s largest private sector labor union, said it was clear the United States did not want a deal. \\u201cNAFTA is not going anywhere. This thing is going into the toilet,\\u201d Jerry Dias told reporters on Thursday. Despite clear signs of impatience from Canada in particular, U.S. negotiators have yet to submit their proposal on rules of origin for the auto sector. That looked unlikely to come before Friday, another official familiar with the talks said. Trump on Wednesday repeated his warnings that he might terminate the pact and said he was open to doing a bilateral deal with either Canada or Mexico. He was speaking alongside Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who later said Canada was \\u201cbraced\\u201d for Trump\\u2019s unpredictability. Negotiators were also set to cover the difficult issue of government procurement on Thursday. Canada and Mexico want their companies to be able to bid on more U.S. federal and state government contracts, but this is at odds with Trump\\u2019s \\u201cBuy American\\u201d agenda. U.S. negotiators have countered with a proposal that would effectively grant the other countries less access, people familiar with the talks say. On automotive rules of origin, NAFTA negotiators face tough new U.S. demands to increase regional vehicle content to 85 percent from 62.5 percent, with 50 percent required from the United States, according to people briefed on the plan.  The rules of origin demands are among several conditions that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has labeled \\u201cpoison pill proposals\\u201d that threaten to torpedo the talks. \",\n          \"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City\\u2019s Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a $82.2 billion budget plan for the 2017 fiscal year on Tuesday, and promised an overhaul of the city\\u2019s ailing public hospitals that treat large numbers of undocumented patients. De Blasio, who hails from progressive circles of the Democratic Party, took office in 2014 after winning a landslide victory on a platform to reduce inequalities in the city. \\u201cAt its core, our budget is our roadmap for lifting up communities,\\u201d de Blasio said. \\u201cThe strategic investments we have put to work in every neighborhood, coupled with disciplined fiscal management, are producing real results for New Yorkers.\\u201d De Blasio said the city\\u2019s public hospital system, recently rebranded as Health & Hospitals, is facing spiraling costs due to undocumented patients and would see a $1.8 billion deficit by 2020 if the city took no action. The executive budget dedicates $2 billion to overhauling the $7.5 billion system, which treats around 1.4 million people per year. About a third of its patients are undocumented immigrants and cost the system over $2 billion each year, the mayor said. Health & Hospitals core revenue from treating poorer patients on federal and state support is under pressure as more private hospitals compete for these patients. That has left the system with a larger share of undocumented patients.     The executive budget plan for the fiscal year beginning July 1 closely tracks a preliminary budget estimate of $82.1 billion the mayor presented in January. The total budget represents a small increase over the previous year\\u2019s $81.7 billion spending plan. The executive budget increases the city\\u2019s reserves by $250 million, bringing its retiree health benefits trust fund to $3.7 billion. General reserves amount to $1 billion and $500 million is allocated to the city\\u2019s capital stabilization reserve. Budget officials said reserves were the highest in the city\\u2019s history. The mayor has repeatedly stressed the need to prepare for an economic downtown in which the city would have to \\u201cgo it alone\\u201d with reduced federal and state support. \",\n          \"The author of  Clinton Cash  responds to Hillary Clinton s brazen dishonesty. Who does she think she s fooling   is she lying or just very incompetent? I think it s brazen dishonesty.  I was not personally involved because that wasn t something the secretary of state did,  said Clinton.The transfer of 20 percent of US uranium   the stuff used to build nuclear weapons   to Vladimir Putin did not rise to the level of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s time and attention?Beyond being an admission of extreme executive negligence on an issue of utmost national security, Hillary s statement strains credulity to the breaking point for at least three other reasons.First, nine investors who profited from the uranium deal collectively donated $145 million to Hillary s family foundation, including Clinton Foundation mega donor and Canadian mining billionaire Frank Giustra, who pledged $100 million. Since 2005, Giustra and Bill Clinton have frequently globetrotted together, and there s even a Clinton Foundation initiative named the Clinton-Giustra initiative. But Hillary expects Americans to believe she had no knowledge that a man who made a nine-figure donation to her foundation was deeply involved in the deal? Nor eight other mining executives, all of whom also donated to her foundation?Second, during her Sunday interview, Clinton was asked about the Kremlin-backed bank that paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a single speech delivered in Moscow. Hillary s response? She dodged the question completely and instead offered this blurry evasion.  The timing doesn t work,  said Clinton.  It happened in terms of the support for the foundation before I was secretary of state.  Hillary added that such  allegations  are being  made by people who are wielding the partisan axe.  The reason Hillary ignored addressing the $500,000 direct payment from the Kremlin-backed bank to her husband is because that payment occurred, as the Times confirms,  shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One.  And as for her comment that the timing of the uranium investors  donations  doesn t work  as a damning revelation, in fact, the timing works perfectly. As Clinton Cash revealed and others have confirmed, Uranium One s then-chief Ian Telfer made donations totaling $2.35 million that Hillary Clinton s foundation kept hidden. Telfer s donations occurred as Hillary s State Department was considering the Uranium One deal. Third, Clinton correctly notes in the interview that  there were nine government agencies who had to sign off on that deal.  What she leaves out, of course, is that her State Department was one of them, and the only agency whose chief received $145 million in donations from shareholders in the deal.

(Reuters) - Washington has dramatically increased tensions in talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement by proposing that the lifespan of any new deal be limited to five years, people familiar with the negotiations said on Thursday. The proposal for a so-called sunset clause - just one of a series of U.S. initiatives that are opposed by NAFTA partners Canada and Mexico - only served to increase uncertainty about the future of the deal. Two sources with direct knowledge of the talks described the atmosphere as \\u201chorrible\\u201d and highly charged. The U.S. side proposed the sunset clause late on Wednesday during the fourth of seven scheduled rounds to update the rules governing one of the world\\u2019s biggest trade blocs, said two officials, who asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential. The Trump administration says the clause, causing NAFTA to expire every five years unless all three countries agree it should continue, is to ensure the pact stays up to date. But Mexico and Canada insist there is no point updating the pact with such a threat hanging over it, arguing the clause would stunt investment by sowing too much uncertainty about the future of the agreement. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a source of total uncertainty,\\u201d said one of the NAFTA government officials. Speaking in Mexico City, Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said the government was working on plans to alter tariffs and identify substitute markets in case the NAFTA talks failed. His remarks and the tension around NAFTA helped push the peso down 1 percent against the U.S. dollar to a five-month low. U.S. President Donald Trump says NAFTA, originally signed in 1994, has been a disaster for the United States and has frequently threatened to scrap it unless major changes are made. Business and farm groups say abandoning the 23-year-old pact would wreak economic havoc, disrupting cross-border manufacturing supply chains and slapping high tariffs on agricultural products. Trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico has quadrupled under NAFTA, now topping $1.2 trillion a year. In addition to the sunset clause, the United States wants to boost how much North American content autos must contain to qualify for tax-free status and eliminate a dispute settlement mechanisms that Canada insists must stay. Some trade observers said it is difficult to see how negotiators could reach an agreement given U.S. demands that many see as non-starters. The head of Unifor, Canada\\u2019s largest private sector labor union, said it was clear the United States did not want a deal. \\u201cNAFTA is not going anywhere. This thing is going into the toilet,\\u201d Jerry Dias told reporters on Thursday. Despite clear signs of impatience from Canada in particular, U.S. negotiators have yet to submit their proposal on rules of origin for the auto sector. That looked unlikely to come before Friday, another official familiar with the talks said. Trump on Wednesday repeated his warnings that he might terminate the pact and said he was open to doing a bilateral deal with either Canada or Mexico. He was speaking alongside Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who later said Canada was \\u201cbraced\\u201d for Trump\\u2019s unpredictability. Negotiators were also set to cover the difficult issue of government procurement on Thursday. Canada and Mexico want their companies to be able to bid on more U.S. federal and state government contracts, but this is at odds with Trump\\u2019s \\u201cBuy American\\u201d agenda. U.S. negotiators have countered with a proposal that would effectively grant the other countries less access, people familiar with the talks say. On automotive rules of origin, NAFTA negotiators face tough new U.S. demands to increase regional vehicle content to 85 percent from 62.5 percent, with 50 percent required from the United States, according to people briefed on the plan.  The rules of origin demands are among several conditions that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has labeled \\u201cpoison pill proposals\\u201d that threaten to torpedo the talks. \",\n          \"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City\\u2019s Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a $82.2 billion budget plan for the 2017 fiscal year on Tuesday, and promised an overhaul of the city\\u2019s ailing public hospitals that treat large numbers of undocumented patients. De Blasio, who hails from progressive circles of the Democratic Party, took office in 2014 after winning a landslide victory on a platform to reduce inequalities in the city. \\u201cAt its core, our budget is our roadmap for lifting up communities,\\u201d de Blasio said. \\u201cThe strategic investments we have put to work in every neighborhood, coupled with disciplined fiscal management, are producing real results for New Yorkers.\\u201d De Blasio said the city\\u2019s public hospital system, recently rebranded as Health & Hospitals, is facing spiraling costs due to undocumented patients and would see a $1.8 billion deficit by 2020 if the city took no action. The executive budget dedicates $2 billion to overhauling the $7.5 billion system, which treats around 1.4 million people per year. About a third of its patients are undocumented immigrants and cost the system over $2 billion each year, the mayor said. Health & Hospitals core revenue from treating poorer patients on federal and state support is under pressure as more private hospitals compete for these patients. That has left the system with a larger share of undocumented patients.     The executive budget plan for the fiscal year beginning July 1 closely tracks a preliminary budget estimate of $82.1 billion the mayor presented in January. The total budget represents a small increase over the previous year\\u2019s $81.7 billion spending plan. The executive budget increases the city\\u2019s reserves by $250 million, bringing its retiree health benefits trust fund to $3.7 billion. General reserves amount to $1 billion and $500 million is allocated to the city\\u2019s capital stabilization reserve. Budget officials said reserves were the highest in the city\\u2019s history. The mayor has repeatedly stressed the need to prepare for an economic downtown in which the city would have to \\u201cgo it alone\\u201d with reduced federal and state support. \",\n          \"The author of  Clinton Cash  responds to Hillary Clinton s brazen dishonesty. Who does she think she s fooling   is she lying or just very incompetent? I think it s brazen dishonesty.  I was not personally involved because that wasn t something the secretary of state did,  said Clinton.The transfer of 20 percent of US uranium   the stuff used to build nuclear weapons   to Vladimir Putin did not rise to the level of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s time and attention?Beyond being an admission of extreme executive negligence on an issue of utmost national security, Hillary s statement strains credulity to the breaking point for at least three other reasons.First, nine investors who profited from the uranium deal collectively donated $145 million to Hillary s family foundation, including Clinton Foundation mega donor and Canadian mining billionaire Frank Giustra, who pledged $100 million. Since 2005, Giustra and Bill Clinton have frequently globetrotted together, and there s even a Clinton Foundation initiative named the Clinton-Giustra initiative. But Hillary expects Americans to believe she had no knowledge that a man who made a nine-figure donation to her foundation was deeply involved in the deal? Nor eight other mining executives, all of whom also donated to her foundation?Second, during her Sunday interview, Clinton was asked about the Kremlin-backed bank that paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a single speech delivered in Moscow. Hillary s response? She dodged the question completely and instead offered this blurry evasion.  The timing doesn t work,  said Clinton.  It happened in terms of the support for the foundation before I was secretary of state.  Hillary added that such  allegations  are being  made by people who are wielding the partisan axe.  The reason Hillary ignored addressing the $500,000 direct payment from the Kremlin-backed bank to her husband is because that payment occurred, as the Times confirms,  shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One.  And as for her comment that the timing of the uranium investors  donations  doesn t work  as a damning revelation, in fact, the timing works perfectly. As Clinton Cash revealed and others have confirmed, Uranium One s then-chief Ian Telfer made donations totaling $2.35 million that Hillary Clinton s foundation kept hidden. Telfer s donations occurred as Hillary s State Department was considering the Uranium One deal. Third, Clinton correctly notes in the interview that  there were nine government agencies who had to sign off on that deal.  What she leaves out, of course, is that her State Department was one of them, and the only agency whose chief received $145 million in donations from shareholders in the deal. Does she honestly expect Americans to believe she was simply unaware that the deal was even under consideration in her own State Department?Read more here: New York Post\"\n        ],\n

It s one thing to have a conservative pundit who can represent  the other side  of the aisle; it s quite another when he s the turning out to be a big fan of a racist, sexist demagogue.CNN s Dylan Byers spoke with numerous sources within MSNBC and found that there is broad agreement that Scarborough is embarrassing both himself and the network with the Trump love.In background discussions, NBC News and MSNBC journalists, reporters and staffers said there was widespread discomfort at the network over Scarborough s friendship with Trump and his increasingly favorable coverage of the candidate. People don t like that Joe is promoting Trump,  one MSNBC insider said. Others described Scarborough s admiration for Trump as  over the top  and  unseemly. Four of those sources also said that the growing media scrutiny over the two men s relationship has caused the network s leadership to more closely monitor Scarborough s comments.  The higher-ups are definitely aware about what s going on,  said another person within MSNBC.  It s an issue. This comes just a few days after Scarborough was very publicly called out for visiting Trump in New Hampshire on the night of the election to celebrate his landslide victory. The next day, Trump went on Morning Joe to personally thank Scarborough and co-host Mika Brzezinski for their  support  for his campaign. It raised more than a few eyebrows.Hilariously, Scarborough seemed to deny both that he went to Trump s hotel room (he did) and that he  supported  Trump (he does). This sharply contrasts with the reality, which is that Scarborough has consistently painted Trump in a positive light.In recent weeks, Scarborough has spoken about Trump in increasingly glowing terms, praising him as  a masterful politician  and defending him against his political opponents and media critics. The Washington Post has noted that Trump has received  a tremendous degree of warmth from the show,  and that his appearances on the show, in person and over the phone, often feel like  a cozy social club. Scarborough also confessed that he coached Trump during his debate prep.Listening to Scarborough talk about Trump and it s obvious there is a lot of admiration there. Trump s blustering stupidity Scarborough mistakes for decisiveness. He may be a small government ideologue, but he likes that Trump wants total control over everything. It s a tyrannical bent that appeals to a guy like Scarborough who views anyone who uses diplomacy or thoughtful, measured responses as  weak. Hey Iran, you have exactly 300 days left to push a US president around. Enjoy it while you can. After that, there will be hell to pay.  Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) January 12, 2016This is, of course, a nightmare for MSNBC s reputation. Donald Trump might rev Scarborough s engine, but the Republican candidate has consistently demonstrated that he is a racist, xenophobic, hate-mongering narcissist. He has absolutely no realistic policy plans (building a great wall on the border with Mexico doesn t count) and no political experience. Watching one of MSNBC s star hosts worship a guy like this is difficult to endure.Featured image from MSNBC \",\n          \"Infamous Italian dictator Benito Mussolini anticipated Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump s campaign slogan 89 years before Trump first descended the escalator at his Manhattan headquarters to declare his candidacy.Mussolini visited the United States in 1927 and gave a speech that was recorded by Fox Movietone News in one of the first newsreels with audio and video. In that speech, Mussolini exhorted Americans to  make America great. I am very glad to be able to express my friendly feelings toward the American nation. Friendship with which Italy looks at millions of citizens who, from Alaska to Florida, from the Pacific to the Atlantic, live in the United States, Italy is deeply rooted in our hearts. This feeling created by mutual interests so contributed to preparation of an even brighter era in the lives of both nations.I greet with wonderful energy the American people and I see and recognize among you the salt of your land, as well as ours, my fellow citizens who are working to make America great.I salute the great American people. I salute the Italians of America who unite in a single love of two nations.Mussolini was a fascist dictator who ruled Italy with an iron fist. His regime engaged in assassination of political opponents, and put him in control of nearly all aspects of Italian life without respect for liberty and freedom of speech.A few years after this appearance, Mussolini formed a pact with Germany , forming the Axis along with Japan. Eventually, the three nations were at war against the United States, England, and Russia in World War II. They were of course, completely defeated.In 1945,Mussolini was caught and executed by his own people, shot as he tried to escape the country with his mistress. Make America Great Again  is not the only Trump slogan to be associated with fascism. Throughout his campaign, Trump has declared  America First,  which shares a name with the America First Committee. AFC was a pressure group associated with aviator Charles Lindbergh that was sympathetic to Adolph Hitler and tried to keep America out of World War II.Featured image via Youtube/Flickr\",\n          \"The move by a Twitter employee last week to ban President Trump from the social media platform for 11 minutes received a great deal of attention and offered people a glimpse into how easily someone at Twitter can stop the flow of information from a source he does not like.What did not get a great deal of attention, however, was the fact that Twitter s Acting General Counsel, Sean Edgett, admitted in a prepared statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee that the platform regularly blocked tweets offering information that could paint the Clinton Campaign and DNC in negative lights.Writing for NewsWars, Jerome Corsi notes:At a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism on Tuesday, Sean Edgett, Acting General Counsel for Twitter, admitted in his prepared testimony that Twitter employed in the 2016 election algorithms that censored out hashtags critical (of) Hillary Clinton, including the hashtag #PodestaEmails and the hashtag #DNCLeaks. Is anyone surprised?Twitter execs long ago began showing their biases against conservatives to such an extent that even USA Today brought it up, noting that Twitter s behind-the-scenes team was quick to ban right-wingers like Milo Yiannopoulos for digs he made at the brilliant and ever-so-entertaining actress Leslie Jones.Yet, conservatives say, nothing happened to rapper Talib Kweli and his followers when they attacked black Breitbart reporter Jerome Hudson with racial slurs. When Breitbart contributor Kassy Dillon complained about a Twitter user who sent her harassing tweets and messages, Twitter made the perpetrator delete one tweet that suggested someone shoot Dillon in the head. Now, the big story that many in the pop media evidently don t want you to see is that Twitter actually admits to having censored tweets that might have spread real information injurious to HRC and the DNC during the 2016 election. The Twits claim that they were simply stopping  spambots  from filling their precious space with tweets from unreal people (one might ask how authentic most politicians seem to be in the first place, but that s a different matter), but hidden in their statements are some  tells  that indicate otherwise.For example, Dr. Corsi observes that in sworn testimony to the Judiciary Committee, Edgett stated:For example, our automated spam detection systems helped mitigate the impact of automated Tweets promoting the #PodestaEmails hashtag, which originated with Wikileaks  publication of thousands of emails from the Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta s Gmail account. The core of the hashtag was propagated by Wikileaks, whose account sent out a series of 118 original Tweets containing variants on the hashtag #PodestaEmails referencing the daily installments of the emails released on the Wikileaks website.So, automatically, what Mr. Edgett has admitted tells us that Twitter intentionally tried to stop the circulation of information offered by an authentic user, Wikileaks, offering authentic information that Wikileaks had published revealing real, confirmed e-mails sourced from John Podesta and the DNC. Those e-mails shed extremely important information about corruption within the DNC that worked against Bernie Sanders  campaign, and in favor of Mrs. Clinton s campaign, and later revealed extremely important information about what Mrs. Clinton knew about the attempted overthrow of Syria and the underlying, unconstitutional reasons for the overthrow of Qaddafi in Libya.Edgett also testified that Twitter hid 25% of the  #PodestaEmails  tweets, andAs described in greater detail below, our systems detected and hid just under half (48%) of the Tweets relating to variants of another notable hashtag, #DNCLeak, which concerned the disclosure of leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee. Those would be the e-mails that revealed towering corruption at the DNC and in many offices of pop media   things like new reporters working with the Clinton campaign to offer her easy questions, things like Donna Brazile, then an employee of CNN, feeding Hillary questions prior to a debate with the electrifying wildman, Bernie Sanders.These are issues that were real, and the more people knew about them, the more they disliked Mrs. Clinton   and the more she and the DNC hackmeisters pushed the spurious  Russia Hack  narrative to deflect from their own malfeasance.For entire story- MRCTV \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"US_News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Aug 2, 2015\",\n          \"Feb 18, 2016\",\n          \"May 16, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"flag\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 6778,\n        \"min\": 21417,\n        \"max\": 44897,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 23481,\n        \"samples\": [\n          38908\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tokenized_title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 17899,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['right', 'wing', 'rag', 'post', 'promote', 'scalia', 'death', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'poison']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tokenized_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 17445,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['know', 'like', 'attack', 'like', 'donald', 'trump', 'rosie', 'donnell', 'bitter', 'feud', 'go', 'year', 'clear', 'cruel', 'creepy', 'misogynist', 'truly', 'see', 'trump', 'current', 'campaign', 'trail', 'shouldn', 'surprise', 'day', 'get', 'shock', 'appal', 'say', 'different', 'look', 'past', 'celebrity', 'actually', 'watch', 'listen.in', 'poem', 'post', 'website', 'rosie', 'donnell', 'write', 'donald', 'trump', 'piece', 'encapsulate', 'real', 'estate', 'mogul', 'fail', 'businessman', 'highlight', 'failure', 'outright', 'creepiness', 'go', 'way.the', 'poem', 'read', 'trump', 'perceive', 'powerful', 'wealthy', 'circle', 'long', 'island', 'kid', 'like', 'joke', 'fail', 'tacky', 'large', 'lame', 'gold', 'letter', 'trump', 'like', 'commandhe', 'go', 'vengeance', 'come', 'tipify', 'himdangerous', 'evil', 'richie', 'rich', 'charlatan', 'compassion', 'free', 'creephe', 'smoke', 'mirror', 'truth', 'tell', 'revolutionarysimple', 'truth', 'people', 'night', 'ask', 'https://t.co/q8vgw5xddd', 'pic.twitter.com/oda1tvcrh6', 'rosie', '@rosie', 'april', '2016the', 'fact', 'people', 'draw', 'trump', 'say', 'people', 'republican', 'frontrunner', 'president', 'type', 'person', 'want', 'lead', 'nation', 'hateful', 'vindictive', 'bigoted', 'misogynistic', 'narcissist', 'supporter', 'look', 'deep', 'discover', 'quality', 'desirable', 'way', 'dumb', 'know', 'difference', 'easily', 'respond', 'applause', 'line', 'fit', 'bumper', 'sticker.kudo', 'rosie', 'stand', 'tell', 'like', 'stop', 'rosie', 'stop.feature', 'photo', 'rob', 'kim', 'getty', 'image']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

(Reuters) - Washington has dramatically increased tensions in talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement by proposing that the lifespan of any new deal be limited to five years, people familiar with the negotiations said on Thursday. The proposal for a so-called sunset clause - just one of a series of U.S. initiatives that are opposed by NAFTA partners Canada and Mexico - only served to increase uncertainty about the future of the deal. Two sources with direct knowledge of the talks described the atmosphere as \\u201chorrible\\u201d and highly charged. The U.S. side proposed the sunset clause late on Wednesday during the fourth of seven scheduled rounds to update the rules governing one of the world\\u2019s biggest trade blocs, said two officials, who asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential. The Trump administration says the clause, causing NAFTA to expire every five years unless all three countries agree it should continue, is to ensure the pact stays up to date. But Mexico and Canada insist there is no point updating the pact with such a threat hanging over it, arguing the clause would stunt investment by sowing too much uncertainty about the future of the agreement. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a source of total uncertainty,\\u201d said one of the NAFTA government officials. Speaking in Mexico City, Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said the government was working on plans to alter tariffs and identify substitute markets in case the NAFTA talks failed. His remarks and the tension around NAFTA helped push the peso down 1 percent against the U.S. dollar to a five-month low. U.S. President Donald Trump says NAFTA, originally signed in 1994, has been a disaster for the United States and has frequently threatened to scrap it unless major changes are made. Business and farm groups say abandoning the 23-year-old pact would wreak economic havoc, disrupting cross-border manufacturing supply chains and slapping high tariffs on agricultural products. Trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico has quadrupled under NAFTA, now topping $1.2 trillion a year. In addition to the sunset clause, the United States wants to boost how much North American content autos must contain to qualify for tax-free status and eliminate a dispute settlement mechanisms that Canada insists must stay. Some trade observers said it is difficult to see how negotiators could reach an agreement given U.S. demands that many see as non-starters. The head of Unifor, Canada\\u2019s largest private sector labor union, said it was clear the United States did not want a deal. \\u201cNAFTA is not going anywhere. This thing is going into the toilet,\\u201d Jerry Dias told reporters on Thursday. Despite clear signs of impatience from Canada in particular, U.S. negotiators have yet to submit their proposal on rules of origin for the auto sector. That looked unlikely to come before Friday, another official familiar with the talks said. Trump on Wednesday repeated his warnings that he might terminate the pact and said he was open to doing a bilateral deal with either Canada or Mexico. He was speaking alongside Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who later said Canada was \\u201cbraced\\u201d for Trump\\u2019s unpredictability. Negotiators were also set to cover the difficult issue of government procurement on Thursday. Canada and Mexico want their companies to be able to bid on more U.S. federal and state government contracts, but this is at odds with Trump\\u2019s \\u201cBuy American\\u201d agenda. U.S. negotiators have countered with a proposal that would effectively grant the other countries less access, people familiar with the talks say. On automotive rules of origin, NAFTA negotiators face tough new U.S. demands to increase regional vehicle content to 85 percent from 62.5 percent, with 50 percent required from the United States, according to people briefed on the plan.  The rules of origin demands are among several conditions that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has labeled \\u201cpoison pill proposals\\u201d that threaten to torpedo the talks. \",\n          \"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City\\u2019s Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a $82.2 billion budget plan for the 2017 fiscal year on Tuesday, and promised an overhaul of the city\\u2019s ailing public hospitals that treat large numbers of undocumented patients. De Blasio, who hails from progressive circles of the Democratic Party, took office in 2014 after winning a landslide victory on a platform to reduce inequalities in the city. \\u201cAt its core, our budget is our roadmap for lifting up communities,\\u201d de Blasio said. \\u201cThe strategic investments we have put to work in every neighborhood, coupled with disciplined fiscal management, are producing real results for New Yorkers.\\u201d De Blasio said the city\\u2019s public hospital system, recently rebranded as Health & Hospitals, is facing spiraling costs due to undocumented patients and would see a $1.8 billion deficit by 2020 if the city took no action. The executive budget dedicates $2 billion to overhauling the $7.5 billion system, which treats around 1.4 million people per year. About a third of its patients are undocumented immigrants and cost the system over $2 billion each year, the mayor said. Health & Hospitals core revenue from treating poorer patients on federal and state support is under pressure as more private hospitals compete for these patients. That has left the system with a larger share of undocumented patients.     The executive budget plan for the fiscal year beginning July 1 closely tracks a preliminary budget estimate of $82.1 billion the mayor presented in January. The total budget represents a small increase over the previous year\\u2019s $81.7 billion spending plan. The executive budget increases the city\\u2019s reserves by $250 million, bringing its retiree health benefits trust fund to $3.7 billion. General reserves amount to $1 billion and $500 million is allocated to the city\\u2019s capital stabilization reserve. Budget officials said reserves were the highest in the city\\u2019s history. The mayor has repeatedly stressed the need to prepare for an economic downtown in which the city would have to \\u201cgo it alone\\u201d with reduced federal and state support. \",\n          \"The author of  Clinton Cash  responds to Hillary Clinton s brazen dishonesty. Who does she think she s fooling   is she lying or just very incompetent? I think it s brazen dishonesty.  I was not personally involved because that wasn t something the secretary of state did,  said Clinton.The transfer of 20 percent of US uranium   the stuff used to build nuclear weapons   to Vladimir Putin did not rise to the level of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s time and attention?Beyond being an admission of extreme executive negligence on an issue of utmost national security, Hillary s statement strains credulity to the breaking point for at least three other reasons.First, nine investors who profited from the uranium deal collectively donated $145 million to Hillary s family foundation, including Clinton Foundation mega donor and Canadian mining billionaire Frank Giustra, who pledged $100 million. Since 2005, Giustra and Bill Clinton have frequently globetrotted together, and there s even a Clinton Foundation initiative named the Clinton-Giustra initiative. But Hillary expects Americans to believe she had no knowledge that a man who made a nine-figure donation to her foundation was deeply involved in the deal? Nor eight other mining executives, all of whom also donated to her foundation?Second, during her Sunday interview, Clinton was asked about the Kremlin-backed bank that paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a single speech delivered in Moscow. Hillary s response? She dodged the question completely and instead offered this blurry evasion.  The timing doesn t work,  said Clinton.  It happened in terms of the support for the foundation before I was secretary of state.  Hillary added that such  allegations  are being  made by people who are wielding the partisan axe.  The reason Hillary ignored addressing the $500,000 direct payment from the Kremlin-backed bank to her husband is because that payment occurred, as the Times confirms,  shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One.  And as for her comment that the timing of the uranium investors  donations  doesn t work  as a damning revelation, in fact, the timing works perfectly. As Clinton Cash revealed and others have confirmed, Uranium One s then-chief Ian Telfer made donations totaling $2.35 million that Hillary Clinton s foundation kept hidden. Telfer s donations occurred as Hillary s State Department was considering the Uranium One deal. Third, Clinton correctly notes in the interview that  there were nine government agencies who had to sign off on that deal.  What she leaves out, of course, is that her State Department was one of them, and the only agency whose chief received $145 million in donations from shareholders in the deal. Does she honestly expect Americans to believe she was simply unaware that the deal was even under consideration in her own State Department?Read more here: New York Post\"\n        ],\n
